# Logistic Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent

This repository is an implementation of the logistic regression. It basically trains a logistic regression classifier model on the dataset given as `data_logistic.mat` and tests it with a %30 random portion of the dataset. At the end, it plots the results in a 3D graph, number of epochs, learning rates and the percentage error rate as the axes.
